greetign = {};
console.log(greetign);
```

- A: `{}`
- B: `ReferenceError: greetign is not defined`
- C: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>B</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: ?

function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

sum(1, "2");
```

- A: `NaN`
- B: `TypeError`
- C: `"12"`
- D: `3`

<details><summary><b>C</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: ?

<i>The answer wil be c because we tried here to do the work of sum between a number and a string , but according to the rules of js we cannot add a number to a string if it is tried then js convert the the number into string and then concatenate them as string.  It happens when we use two string to perform addition or one string and one number </i>

###### 3. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
const food = ["🍕", "🍫", "🥑", "🍔"];
const info = { favoriteFood: food[0] };

info.favoriteFood = "🍝";

console.log(food);
```

- A: `['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- B: `['🍝', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- C: `['🍝', '🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>A</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: ?

<i>Here at first we declare an array then we declare a object by copying the first element of the array. Then we changed the value of info.favoritefood but that is not related to the first array it is related to the object and its value so the array will remain same</i>

###### 4. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
function sayHi(name) {
  return `Hi there, ${name}`;
}

console.log(sayHi());
```

- A: `Hi there,`
- B: `Hi there, undefined`
- C: `Hi there, null`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>B</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: ?

<i>The answer will be B. Because in the the template string we are expecting a value that will be passed through the parameter of sayHi function when we call the function . But in this case we call the function without parameter thats why the value is read as undefined </i>

###### 5. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
let count = 0;
const nums = [0, 1, 2, 3];

nums.forEach((num) => {
  if (num) count += 1;
});

console.log(count);
```

- A: 1
- B: 2
- C: 3
- D: 4

<details><summary><b>C</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: ?

<i>Here the correct answer is C . Because we increment the value of count if the num is true. In the nums array there are four element, but one is 0. So by for each loop we find the value of num 0,1,2,3 in this case when the value  of num is 0 then num is false and so count value won't increase.</i>
